JaRemPro is a simple reminder app developed using java with simplicity and usability as its main focus. The app was completely developed using java and Swing libraries. The app can be run in both GUI and in terminal. I have designed it for terminal initially but later added GUI which makes it easier for anyone to use the app. To used it in terminal please set JaRemPro app as a local environmental variable. Once done you can simply type "JaRemPro" in terminal followed with task and time to use it. For GUI just place the "JaRemPro.exe" in desktop and double click it to execute it. The app includes basic features like snooze and multiple reminders. I will add more features in the future. Currently I am working on to run the app as an startup app and save and show the reminders even the machine gets restarted.
